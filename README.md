# Teorica-MachineLearning
* Basically, this is all the theoretical side of what envelops machine-learning that.
* This notebook range from the most basic to the most complex, statistical algorithms. And mathematical theories.
* So yeah it starts out with, thing like linear regression or what is a median, and it goes bonkers and goes to how deep neural networks function and so on
* Also, i like to make a little note i am proud  how big it become as time passed
* Unfortunately most of it is in portuguese (i did a lot of translation).
* I hope those who see it enjopy it
